# About this project  

This project the the corrected revision about https://java.net/projects/aerith. Every copyrights blong to the authors of that project.   

I have fixed all compilation errors with [jogl 2.x](https://jogamp.org/jogl/www/)

Because my IDE is netbeans, so if you use NetBean 7.x, you should add these two libraries:  

*junit*  

This library is the built-in library of NetBean ide. if you don't install it. You must manual create one.  

*jogl*  

This library is created by me. these library contains the following files
