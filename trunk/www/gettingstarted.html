    <h2>Aerith: Getting Started</h2>
    
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    
    <p>To get Aerith running you must first download the source code to Aerith, the SwingX project
    from Swing Labs, and JOGL. You also need to be running a recent build of Mustang. You will
    also need to compile using NetBeans.
    Because Aerith is graphics intensive and uses cutting edge technology you need to
    run it on a computer with a 3d graphics accelerator and Open GL drivers installed.</p>
    
    <p>If you have any problems compiling or running Aerith please post a 
    question to the <a href="https://aerith.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList"><b>users</b> mailing list.</a></p>
    
    <h3>Compliation and Installation</h3>
    
    <ol>
    
    <li>Download and install the most recent Mustang beta (Java SE 6.0) from the <a href="https://mustang.dev.java.net/">Mustang project</a>.</li>
    
    <li>Download JOGL (Java Open GL bindings) from <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/">the JOGL homepage</a>. Be sure you get both the
    jogl.jar file and the native libraries for your platform. You can get precompiled binaries from 
    <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=5476&expandFolder=5476&folderID=0">the download page</a>.
    </li>
    
    <li>Install JOGL by unjarring the <code>jogl-natives<i>[your platform]</i>.jar</code> file. It should create several native libraries. Put the native
    libs in your library path and the jogl.jar in your classpath.
    
    <ul>
        <li>Mac OS X:	Put the jogl.jar and the *.jnilib files in the <code>/Library/Java/Extensions</code> directory</li>
        <li>Windows [need help on this one]</li>
        <li>Unix [need help on this one]</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Check out the code for SwingX from <a href="http://swingx.dev.java.net/">swingx.dev.java.net</a>. You will need CVS tools installed. (Built into NetBeans)</li>
    
    <li>Check out the code for Aerith. You will need Subversion tools installed. (Built into NetBeans 5.5)</li>
    
    <li>Open the Aerith project in NetBeans and resolve the broken references. You will need to tell the Aerith project
    where you have downloaded the SwingX project, where the JOGL jar is, and where your lib directory is.</li>
    
    <li>Compile and run Aerith. If it you have problems please post it to 
    <a href="https://aerith.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">the mailing list</a>.
